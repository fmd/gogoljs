# tape-run

A [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) test runner that runs your tests in
a (headless) browser and returns 0/1 as exit code, so you can use it as your
`npm test` script.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/tape-run.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/tape-run)

## Usage

First write a test utilizing [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) and save
it to `test/test.js`:

```js
var test = require('tape');

test('a test', function (t) {
  t.ok(true);
  t.end();
});
```

Then run this command using tape-run and
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/browserify) and watch the magic happen
as the TAP results stream in from a browser:

```bash
$ browserify test/*.js | tape-run
TAP version 13
# one
ok 1 true

1..1
# tests 1
# pass  1

# ok

$ echo $?
0
```

## API

You can use tape-run from JavaScript too:

```js
var run = require('tape-run');
var browserify = require('browserify');

browserify(__dirname + '/test/test.js')
  .bundle()
  .pipe(run())
  .on('results', console.log)
  .pipe(process.stdout);
```

And run it:

```bash
$ node example/api.js
TAP version 13
# one
ok 1 true

1..1
# tests 1
# pass  1

# ok
{ ok: true,
  asserts: [ { ok: true, number: 1, name: 'true' } ],
  pass: [ { ok: true, number: 1, name: 'true' } ],
  fail: [],
  errors: [],
  plan: { start: 1, end: 1 } }
```

### run([opts])

`opts` can be:

* `wait (Number) [Default: 1000]`: Make `tap-finished` wait longer for results.
Increase this value if tests finish without all tests being run.
* `port (Number)`: If you specify a port it will wait for you to open a browser
on `http://localhost:<port>` and tests will be run there.
* `browser (String)`: Browser to use. Defaults to `phantom`. Available if installed:
  * `chrome`
  * `firefox`
  * `ie`
  * `phantom`
  * `safari`

The **CLI** takes the same arguments:

```bash
$ tape-run --help
Pipe a browserify stream into this.
browserify [opts] [files] | tape-run [opts]

Options:
  --wait, -w     Timeout for tap-finished
  --port, -p     Wait to be opened by a browser on that port
  --browser, -b  Browser to use. Available if installed: chrome, firefox, ie, phantom, safari  [default: "phantom"]
  --help, -h     Print usage instructions

```

## Installation

With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do

```bash
$ npm install tape-run -g # for cli
$ npm install tape-run    # for api
```
